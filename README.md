## Project description

VoZZ is a very simple application. It provides the user with route information and real-time notifications, such as suspended traffic, call to action and the like.

Users can also check the status of their card by entering the card number, and thus the application will display how much funds they currently have on the card.

Users can search by location where they want to go. Information about the requested route includes the amount of the ticket, as well as the stations entering the route.
